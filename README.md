## UPDATE!!!
- **[For those who are using Fabric 1.20.4 v1.5] Please delete the following mods: AppleSkin, Continuity, Fast Trading, freelook, Gamma Utils, Longer Chat History, Macro Keybinds, MinecraftCapes, ViaFabricPlus (maybe u need this), WorldHost, WorldEdit +  CUI. Looks like disabled mods are still being added, next time I'll delete them instead of disabling them. If you need some mods in the list, just enable them.**
- [For AMD/Intel GPU users] Please disable/remove mod "Nvidium" for Fabric or "Acedium" for NeoForge if you don't want the game to crash due to incompatibility with your GPU, thank you for reading.

## UPDATE!!!
- **[For those who are using Fabric 1.20.4 v1.5] Please delete the following mods: AppleSkin, Continuity, Fast Trading, freelook, Gamma Utils, Longer Chat History, Macro Keybinds, MinecraftCapes, ViaFabricPlus (maybe u need this), WorldHost, WorldEdit +  CUI. Looks like disabled mods are still being added, next time I'll delete them instead of disabling them. If you need some mods in the list, just enable them.**
- After pondering, I decided to remove all mods that provide similar features to OptiFine, because these mods have reduced the modpack's performance, as well as compatibility with servers using custom resourcepacks.
- From now on, this modpack will prioritize game performance instead of supporting resourcepack features.
- [For AMD/Intel GPU users] Please disable/remove mod "[Nvidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/nvidium)" for Fabric or "[Acedium](https://github.com/ferriarnus/acedium)" for NeoForge if you don't want the game to crash due to incompatibility with your GPU, thank you for reading.
